### Flappy Bird Remixed

A personal project I created to learn the basics of game development in Unity. All the sprites were created from scratch to practice and improve my pixel art skills as well.

---

### Development
This project was my way of getting familiar with the **Unity** engine and its core concepts like game objects, scenes, and scripting.

---

### Future Plans
This is a basic version, and I'm hoping to continue adding new features and polishing the game based on feedback. Some ideas I have in mind include:
* Adding new bird characters with unique designs
* Creating different environments and backgrounds
* Implementing a high-score system
* Adding a pause menu
* Adding some background music

Also included PC build in the repo if that works better.
